1. 1. Print only the first 4 fields from each even-numbered line from a file, considering that 
the fields are separated by whitespaces. If a line has fewer than 4 fields, print all the fields from that line.

2. Print all the lines that contain only non-alphanumeric characters from a file. (any character that
isn’t a letter or a digit).

3. Duplicate each occurrence of an integer number from a file. We will consider that an integer
number is a sequence of neighboring base 10 digits.

4. Delete all characters after the last whitespace from each line from a file.

5. Print the line number and the field from the middle of the line from each line that contains an
odd number of fields from a file. Consider that the fields are separated by whitespaces. Note:
division in awk is by default float division. If you need the integer part of a division use the int

6. Swap field number 2 with field number 3 from a file where the fields are separated by the “:”
character

7. Print all lines that contain at most 5 vowels, not necessarily consecutive, situated between 2 ^
signs from a file.

8. Remove the first word containing only lowercase letters from each line of a file

9. Print the number of processes run by each user in the system (in the format nr_processes user).

10.  For each file from the current directory, display only the name of the file and the permissions
for the user. (not the permissions for the group or for other; you can use ls -l to get information
about files and folders from the current directory)

11. Display the number of lines that end in a vowel and the number of lines that end in a
consonant from a file.
